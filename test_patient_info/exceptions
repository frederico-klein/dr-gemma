So here i think it is important to have some supervision of the LLM. 

So we check if they did the things appropriately, like , did they tick all the boxes, 

One of the things I had to do is complain that the LLM didn't ask for the patients' chart data. 

This is what I did:

SUPERVISOR MESSAGE: we recommend the LLM to use the commands provided to review patient information
